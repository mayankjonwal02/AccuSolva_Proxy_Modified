      <p className='mt-6'>PRAVEEN NANDKISHOR JOSHI believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
      <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '35pt', listStyleType: 'disc' , textAlign: 'justify',gap:'10px',paddingTop:'10px'}}>
    <li>
        <p className="s2" style={{ textIndent: '10pt', textAlign: 'justify',paddingTop:'10px' }}>
            <span className="p">
            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them            </span>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p className="s2" style={{ textIndent: '10pt', textAlign: 'justify',paddingTop:'10px' }}>
