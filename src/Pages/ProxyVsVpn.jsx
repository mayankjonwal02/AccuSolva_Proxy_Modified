            When you need to hide your real identity or protect yourself while
            online, you’ll definitely end up choosing between a VPN and a proxy.
            Though there are some functions they both fulfill, VPNs and proxies
            aren’t interchangeable. To make the right choice, you have to
            understand your use case and know more about VPNs and proxies. In
            this article, we’ll dive into what proxies and VPNs are, how they
            can benefit your business, and what is reasonable to use depending
            on your needs.

              What is a VPN?

              A VPN stands for “virtual private network”. When you type a
              request and press “Enter”, a VPN server creates an encrypted
              tunnel. Encryption means that the data you send is ciphered. Your
              data goes through that tunnel to a VPN server. The server then
              sends it to the target server. The target server sees the IP and
              location of a VPN server. Basically, a VPN creates a private
              network inside a global network so you don’t contact the global
              web directly.

              Even if you exchange information only between trusted parties, bad
              actors may intercept your data while transferring it. It’s called
              a man-in-the-middle attack. Yet if the data is encrypted by a VPN,
              it’s useless to steal it. In the process of encryption, two
              special keys are created. They are used to decipher encrypted
              data. You may think of them as passwords. It’s impossible to
              figure out those keys or guess them. If intercepted but not
              deciphered, the data looks like strings of random symbols that
              make no sense. That’s why a VPN offers you a huge security
              advantage as you’re protected from hackers. As your data travels
              inside an encrypted tunnel, nobody, including your internet
              service provider, can see what sources you visit or what you do
              there. Your security and privacy are taken care of.

              Browsers and servers communicate with each other on several
              levels. To describe it, the Open Systems Interconnection model
              exists. It consists of seven layers. Depending on the layer a VPN
              works on, you can route traffic only from a particular app or from
              everywhere.  It’s very convenient since you usually use a VPN only
              for particular tasks. Routing all the traffic will unnecessarily
              increase your bills and slow down the connection.

              VPNs are used by businesses to control who has access to sensitive
              internal data. Due to encryption, VPNs are also used to secure
              sensitive operations that involve sending documents, dealing with
              employees’ data, or entering payment details. A lot of parties or
              competitors may be after companies. Hackers may want to get your
              data to steal your money. Your competitors may try to track down
              your online activity to learn more about your company’s internal
              affairs. Your internet service provider may collect and sell your
              information to third parties.

              Sometimes you or your workers have to use public networks like
              Wi-Fi at the airport or in a cafe, which is dangerous. VPNs can
              help with all those issues. It not only shields your online
              activity but also protects your data. So you can safely send
              important information or use Wi-Fi in public places, even for
              business needs.

              What are proxies?

              A proxy is a middleman between you and the global web. Usually,
              when you google something, your browser sends requests directly to
              the Internet. With proxies, your requests come to the proxy
              server. The server then forwards your requests to the target
              server. Not your real IP, but a proxy’s IP and location are
              visible to the target server. Your connection may be encrypted or
              not. It depends on the protocol a proxy works on. For example, the
              SOCKS protocol doesn’t encrypt your data, while the HTTPS protocol
              does. You can choose what protocol to use depending on your needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[20px]/[32px] text-[#3B3C4A] font-['Source Serif Pro'] text-justify">
              There are several types of proxies: datacentre, residential, and
              mobile. Datacentre proxies are a little similar to VPNs since
              their IPs are also generated by servers. Residential and mobile
              proxies are the IPs of real people’s devices. People install
              special apps on their gadgets and opt to sell a part of their
              traffic to proxy providers. When you buy proxies from a provider,
              you use that traffic. So, with proxies, it’s like you’re using
              somebody’s device. Practically, the global web sees you as another
              person and has no clue that you’re not an ordinary user.

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-6">

            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[20px]/[32px] text-[#3B3C4A] font-['Source Serif Pro'] text-justify">
              The biggest advantage of proxies is that you can have the IPs of
              real human devices and not artificial, server-generated addresses.
              When you use server-generated IPs, your real identity and location
              remain hidden. Yet, it’s quite easy to detect that requests come
              from a VPN or a proxy. So, the net knows that something is going
              on and that you are hiding your real self. It may seem suspicious
              to some sites. As a result, they may block you. That’s why it’s
              often necessary to use proxies because they can provide you with a
              real IP. Authentic IPs can help you access practically any website
              and stay out of the anti-bot system’s radar. Moreover, proxy
              providers can provide you with many more IPs than VPN providers.
              When you have a lot of authentic IPs, it becomes significantly
              easier to trick sites into thinking that you’re an ordinary
              customer.

            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[20px]/[32px] text-[#3B3C4A] font-['Source Serif Pro'] text-justify">
              One more plus is that proxies give you more freedom since you can
              adjust them according to your needs. For example, choose between
              different protocols. With different protocols, you can have
              different benefits. For instance, the HTTPS protocol will encrypt
              your traffic and ensure that your data reaches its final
              destination. However, there are situations when you aren’t dealing
              with sensitive information and don’t need encryption but crave
              speed, e.g., while streaming. Then the SOCKS protocol will be the
              best choice, as it will help you bypass geo-based restrictions,
              hide your real IP, and at the same time provide you with a fast
              connection.

              Ad verification, SERP tracking, price comparison, and all the
              tasks that require web scraping require proxies. With proxies, you
              can have your IP rotated, or, in other words, changed with every
              request. It will help you bypass anti-bot systems that sites often
              implement to protect themselves from scraping. Web scraping is
              practically impossible to implement with the majority of VPNs
              since you’ll have to manually change your IP. It’s long and not
              effective. A few progressive VPN providers offer IP rotation.
              Still, it’s not the same as proxy rotation. IPs provided by VPN
              providers are server-generated. It increases your chances of
              getting detected and banned.

              There is no silver bullet if you’re trying to choose between
              proxies and a VPN. To make the right choice, you need to
              understand your use case. If security is your main priority, a VPN
              is a good choice. On the other hand, proxies are often more handy
              for certain business tasks like SERP tracking or ad verification.
              With proxies, you can use authentic IPs, while the IPs of a VPN
              are server-generated. A VPN cannot replace proxies in those cases.
              With DataImpulse, you can have safe residential proxies at a
              modest price of $1 per 1GB. There are 5+ million IPs available, so
              you can easily scrape the web, get over geo-based limitations, and
              protect your privacy without risking being banned anywhere. Start
